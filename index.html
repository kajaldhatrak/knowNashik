          <p>
            According to epic of Ramayana , When Ram, Sita and Lakshman lived in
            Panchavati area of Nashik, they cut the nose of Ravana’s sister
            (‘Nasika’ in the Sanskrit language) at this place . Hence it is
            called Nasik. Later on government change it to Nashik, so both nasik
            and Nashik are valid. There are more stories related to the name
            origin.
